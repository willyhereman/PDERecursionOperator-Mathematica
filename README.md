Dear user, 

The PDERecursionOperator code computes the recursion operator for polynomial systems of nonlinear PDEs that are completely integrable (i.e., they have an infinite number of higher-order (generalized) symmetries). 

The code uses the InvariantsSymmetries code which is also in the folders. 

Folder V2 contains the 2024 version of the PDERecursionOperator code. The documentation notebook in folder V1 has extra examples.
